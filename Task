# User Management Screen 

## Overview
The User Management Screen is for admins to easily handle user accounts. You can add, edit, view, or enable/disable users.

---

## Features

### What Should It Do?

1. **Add New Users**:
   - Include a form where admins can type in details like Username, Display Name, Phone, Email, User Role, and Enabled status.

2. **See All Users**:
   - Show a table with user info (Username, Email, Enabled status).
   - Make the table sortable and filterable (example: hide users that are disabled).

3. **Edit User Info**:
   - Let admins click on a user in the table to edit their details.

4. **Enable/Disable Users**:
   - Allow admins to turn the Enabled status on or off for a user.

5. **Search & Filter**:
   - Add a checkbox to hide disabled users from the list.

### Extra Features
- Make the design work well on both desktops and mobile devices. 
- Show clear messages if something goes wrong or if a task is successful.

## Page Setup

### Layout

#### Left Side:
- A table showing user details:
  - Columns for Username, Email, and Enabled (enabled with checkbox).
  - Add options to sort and filter.
  - A checkbox for 'Hide Disabled Users.'

#### Right Side:
- A form for adding or editing a user:
  - Fields for:
    - **Username** (text input)
    - **Display Name** (text input)
    - **Phone** (numeric input)
    - **Email** (email input)
    - **User Role** (dropdown or multi-select box)
    - **Enabled** (checkbox).

### Buttons
- **Add New User**:
  - Click this to open the form to add a new user.
- **Save**:
  - Saves the user info after adding or editing.

### Table
1. By default, show all users sorted by Username.
2. Allow sorting by any column (Username, Email, Enabled).
3. If “Hide Disabled Users” is checked, don’t show disabled users in the list.

---

## How It Works

### What Happens First?
- Show all users in the table.
- The Hide Disabled Users checkbox is unchecked.
- The New User form is blank and ready to fill.

### When the Admin Does Stuff:

1. **Adding a User**:
   - Click “Add New User” to clear the form and open it.
   - Fill in the details and click "Save" to add the user to the table.

2. **Editing a User**:
   - Click a user in the table to load their info into the form.
   - Edit the details and click “Save” to update them.

3. **Hiding Disabled Users**:
   - Check “Hide Disabled Users” to filter out users that are disabled.

---

## Rules for Inputs

- All fields in the New User form are required, except for 'Enabled'.
- Email must look like a valid email (example: `user@example.com`).
- Phone numbers should only have numbers. (example: 0 542 555 44 33)

---

## For Errors

1. If required fields are empty, show an error message.
2. If a user is added or updated successfully, show a success message.
3. Highlight any incorrect fields in red (example: invalid email).

---

## Notes for Developers

### Frontend:
- Use a table library for displaying the user list (like DataTables).
- Use validation libraries to check input fields (like making sure emails are valid).

### Backend:
- Provide APIs to handle adding, editing, and viewing user data.
- Make sure user data is secure (example: passwords should be shown in this format: **** if user enter's show my password it will shown).


**For Frontend Page**:
